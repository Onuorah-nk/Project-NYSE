<h1>Project NYSE</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Introduction Project NYSE, i conducted three tasks: 1) complete my own data analysis and create a presentation to share your findings, 2) I develop a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement, and 3) created a Financial Forecasting Model using three scenarios. I started by taking a look at my dataset and brainstorming which sub-category and company i want to focus on for my data analysis 

Project Goals: Here are the three tasks that i completed in the final project.

Task 1: a.I Identify the question about the data that i will answer based on my data analysis. My question will include at least one categorical variable (GICS Sector or GICS Sub Industry) and one quantitative variable (one of the financial metrics) and require the use of at least one of the summary statistics. A tab within the Excel spreadsheet that you submit should include the summary statistics [measures of central tendency (e.g., mean, median) and measures of spread (standard deviation and range)] i will use to answer the question.

b. I Created a presentation that provides at least one visualization to help with my answer. This visualization might be a bar chart, histogram, scatterplot, box-plot or other visual that i learned to make. i Include my insights from the measures of center and spread and at least one numeric summary statistic in the description.

Task 2: Created a dashboard for a Profit and Loss Statement that calculates the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for a company selected from a drop-down list. My drop-down list will pull historical fundamentals data to create the P&L Statement. The P&L statement will include the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT values for all the years there is historical data available for that company in the dataset.

Task 3: Created a financial model for a company (different from Task 2) of my choice that forecasts out the Gross Profit, Operating Profit or EBIT for two more years using three scenarios (Best case, Weak case and Base case). my assumptions for revenue growth, gross margin and operating margin should change for each scenario.
